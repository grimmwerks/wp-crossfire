== Description ==

If you're managing and writing to multiple sites on a WordPress network, you can quickly and easily cross-post your
content to other sites.  The plugin adds a simple menu to the new post screen that allows you to select the blogs you
want the content to appear on.  The post won't be copied, but it will become visible to those other sites immediately.

All comments and interaction will also be mirrored between the linked posts.
